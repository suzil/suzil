## Hello readers! I'm Susannah

  I'm coding all week!
</p>

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [`awsstepfuncs`](https://github.com/suzil/awsstepfuncs) as an easier-than-JSON Python SDK to AWS Step Functions than allows compiling state machines to Amazon States Language and simulating them with mock functions to help with debugging
- 👩‍💻 I believe in taking the extra time to create quality code from the beginning as it's a small initial investment that pays dividends in later maintenance and extension
- 🖋️ I strongly agree with Michael Feathers that legacy code is code without tests
- 🎹 I play the piano and my favorite composer is Debussy
- 🎮 I love playing Super Smash Bros. to decompress from work
- 🤖 .i .o'a mi pu jbopre
